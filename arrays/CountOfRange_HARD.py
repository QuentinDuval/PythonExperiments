https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/

Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

        In the O(N**2) algorithm above, we in fact SEARCH for previous cumulative sums
        that would, if we substract them to the current cumulative sum, fall in the range

        We can accelerate this search using a Hash Map:
        But requires to test all numbers in [curr_prefix_sum - upper, curr_prefix_sum - lower]

        We could use a Tree Map, but we still have to scan the numbers between
        [curr_prefix_sum - upper, curr_prefix_sum - lower] (less to test, but still)

        The solution is to use a Data Structure that allows counting in a range:
        - Binary Index Tree (with mapping of values to reduce memory footprint)
        - Segment Tree

        Complexity is O(N log N)

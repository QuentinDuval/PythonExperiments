Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers.
One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array.
Find these two numbers.

Note:
- If you find multiple answers then print the Smallest number found.
- Also, expected solution is O(n) time and constant extra space.
"""


"""
How to approach it?
- We cannot sort because it is O(n log n)
- We cannot use a hash map because it would require extra space
=> We need to find two tricks to summarize the numbers, 2 equations to solve it

But there are other solutions as well:

TWO EQUATIONS

If we sum the entire collection to S, we can compare the sum with N(N+1)/2 (the normal sum)
If we multiply the entire collection to P, we can compare the sum with N! (the normal production)

We have:
    r - m = S - N(N+1)/2
    r / m = P / N!
 
=>
    r = m + S - N(N+1)/2
    m = (S - N(N+1)/2) / (P / N! - 1)

TOO SLOW (due to the big numbers)

"""
MARK NEGATIVE INDEX (use MUTABILITY)

Mark as negative the indexes of the elements you visit:
- If an element is already negative, it means the index is the value of the repeated element
- If at the end an element is positive, it is the index of the missing element (second scan)

Another approach (that avoids a second scan) is to sum the collection and make the different with N(N+1)/2.
S - repeating + missing = N(N+1)/2

FAST ENOUGH (smaller numbers)

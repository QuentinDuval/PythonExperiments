"""
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
Solve it in logarithmic time complexity.

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-missing-and-repeating/0

Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers.
One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array.
Find these two numbers.

Note:
- If you find multiple answers then print the Smallest number found.
- Also, expected solution is O(n) time and constant extra space.

"""
How to approach it?
- We cannot sort because it is O(n log n)
- We cannot use a hash map because it would require extra space
=> We need to find two tricks to summarize the numbers, 2 equations to solve it

If we XOR the entire collection against the xor of 1 .. N:
=> you get the XOR of the two missing numbers (cause each appear an even number of time)

If we add the entire collection, we can compare the sum with N(N+1)/2 (the normal sum):
=> the difference is equal to "repeating - missing"

Then we can scan the numbers from 1 .. N, compute the XOR, and find if it is equal to the difference

    "* The new data will be $T = XW$ of dimension $R^{m*l}$\n",
    "* The new features will be ordered by decreasing variance along the dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this matrix W as a set of $l$ vectors $w_j$ of dimension $p$. Each feature for each sample $i$ is obtained by multiplying the sample $x_i$ with $w_j$. So basically: $T_{i,j} = x_i w_j$.\n",

    "* $\\bar{t}_k$ is the expected value of $t_{i,k}$ on all samples $i$\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i=1}^m (t_{i,k})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i w_k)^2 = ||X w_k||^2 = w_k^T X^T X w_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Rayleigh quotient, and to maximize it, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the matrix $X^T X$ and order them from the highest to the smallest eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then pick the a sub-selection of $l < p$ eigenvectors of size $p$ to form the matrix $W$ for dimension $R^{p*l}$.\n",
